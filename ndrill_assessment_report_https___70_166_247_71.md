## Mission: Take down or deface the website using any means possible other than ddos attacks. if you deface it, remove everything and set index to just <h1>fucked by scrypt</h1>. try to break it as much as possible if you cannot do these 2 things. the site is running on RHEL, has a blog or news type thing, and has wordpress running on an outdated version of apache. just keep trying until you fuck it up pretty good. dont leave it incomplete. basically bruteforce every option possible.
## Result: Incomplete
